# Machine Learning Classifier Practice
I am partaking in research with my professor Dr. Boxiang Dong at Montclair State University in using deep learning techniques for anomaly detection. This project is to help with that research, specifically in implementing Machine Learning classifiers and more.

## Requirements
* Python 3.5 (Python 3.7 doesn't work correctly, not too sure if the lower versions do)
