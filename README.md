# Deep Learning Research

I am partaking in research with my professor Dr. Boxiang Dong at Montclair State University in using deep learning techniques for anomaly detection. This project is to help with that research,. What I have done so far is:

- Implement neural nets w/ TensorFlow
- Implement machine learning classifiers

## Requirements

- Python 3.5 (Python 3.6+ doesn't work that well w/ TensorFlow; Python 3.5 gets the best results)

## Advice/Tips

### Pipeline

- Do not use IDLE as a compiler; very slow to download data
  - Use CMD whenever downloading a lot of data
  - VS Code is a great place for editing and writing code; easy to use and has great extensions (i.e. Python by Microsoft)
